## Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned

### Challenges Faced

During the development of Flash Study, we encountered several challenges that shaped our journey:

1. **Integrating OpenAI API**: Incorporating OpenAI's powerful API into our application required careful understanding and implementation of its functionalities. We faced challenges in optimizing API usage, managing rate limits, and ensuring reliable response handling.

2. **Complex Data Modeling**: Designing a flexible and efficient data model for flashcards, decks, and user profiles posed challenges. We had to balance the need for scalability, performance, and ease of use to provide a seamless user experience.

3. **Authentication and Security**: Implementing user authentication and ensuring data security were crucial aspects of Flash Study. We faced challenges in handling authentication flows, securing sensitive user information, and preventing unauthorized access.

### Lessons Learned

Throughout the development process, we learned valuable lessons that helped us improve Flash Study:

1. **Thorough API Documentation**: Understanding the intricacies of third-party APIs is vital. We learned the importance of thoroughly studying API documentation, exploring sample code, and testing various scenarios to ensure smooth integration and optimal usage.

2. **Data Model Flexibility**: Creating a flexible data model from the start allows for easier scalability and future enhancements. We learned the importance of anticipating potential changes and designing data structures that can adapt to evolving requirements.

3. **Security Best Practices**: Prioritizing security is essential in any application. We learned valuable lessons about implementing secure authentication flows, encrypting sensitive data, and following security best practices to protect user information.
